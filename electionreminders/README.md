# ElectionReminders

Goal: 
To create a mobile app which offers the user the ability to set up reminders for important elections (local and national). In this repo, we have the backend logic for this app (written with Java and Spring Boot)

Technology: 
Java 21, Maven 3.8.5, and Spring Boot

How to get started: 
Simply start the application in "Application.java". Right now - this will turn on a few endpoints 
which will run on localhost:8080.
